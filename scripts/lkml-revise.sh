# lkml-revise.sh — Launch the author persona to answer review and produce
# the next version of an lkml-mode series.
#
# Usage: lkml-revise.sh <series> --project <path> --checkout <ref> --version <n> --base <ref>
#            [--personas-dir <dir>] [--author <persona>] [--model-override <harness/model>]
#            [--timeout <seconds>] [--services-trust-ref <ref>]
#
# <project>   the repo fork-sandbox.sh clones.
# --checkout  the ref to revise from -- normally the branch vN was posted
#             from, so the author's clone already holds vN's commits.
# --services-trust-ref <ref> is passed through to the author's
#             fork-sandbox.sh launch. Without it, fork-sandbox.sh disables
#             the repo's .agents/sandbox-services hook on a --checkout run
#             (its warning lands in the captured launch output, unseen), so
#             the author gets no per-run services and cannot run suites
#             that need them. Pass the trusted base the series came from.
# --version   the CURRENT version being revised (an integer N). This launch
#             produces vN+1, posted under that version by lkml-mailbox.sh
#             init; the branch is named lkml/<series>-vN+1-<timestamp> (see
#             the launch report for the exact name -- the timestamp is
#             there so a retry after this script refuses downstream, e.g.
#             "committed but left no cover letter" below, does not collide
#             with the branch the failed attempt already fetched).
# --base      the series' ORIGINAL base -- the same ref v1's patches were
#             formatted against (SKILL.md step 1's <base-ref>), NOT vN's
#             tip. The author's commits land on top of vN, so formatting
#             vN's tip..vN+1 would post only this round's fixups as if they
#             were the whole series; formatting the ORIGINAL base..vN+1
#             posts the complete series every time.
# --author    which persona file speaks for the series. Defaults to
#             "author" -- see skills/lkml-mode/personas/author.md.
# --model-override <harness>[/<model>] overrides the author persona's own
#             harness/model for this run only. A BARE harness (no /model)
#             drops the persona's frontmatter model -- a model name belongs
#             to its harness (a bare pi-local resolves from the endpoint,
#             a bare claude takes the harness default); a combined
#             harness/model passes through verbatim. The frontmatter pins
#             are defaults, not policy: this machine's seats file
#             (LKML_SEATS_FILE, else ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-seats.yaml)
#             may re-seat the persona, key by key -- precedence
#             --model-override > seats personas.<p> > seats default: >
#             frontmatter (a seats harness without a model drops the
#             frontmatter's model). A missing file means the pins stand;
#             an unreadable or unparseable one refuses the run before the
#             launch. A seat the seats file changes is announced on stderr,
#             e.g. `lkml-revise: seat author: pi, sealed (lkml-seats.yaml,
#             was claude/opus)`; --model-override wins over the seats file
#             silently.
# --timeout   seconds to wait for the run to finish. Default 3600, which
#             an author round routinely outlives -- measured repeatedly on
#             v6/v7-scale revisions, each still working an hour past the
#             default. Pass something like 10800 for a real revision. What
#             the deadline bounds is only THIS SCRIPT'S WAIT: the run is a
#             detached session that keeps going, commits, and fetches its
#             branch back regardless, so a timeout costs the harvest and
#             the changelog post, not the work. Re-harvest by hand from the
#             run dir named in the error.
#
# Unlike lkml-round.sh, this run is allowed to commit -- that is the whole
# point. The handoff hands the author the full thread tree and everything
# `lkml-mailbox.sh open` flags, and asks it to, for each open item, either
# fix the code (and commit, one logical change per commit rather than one
# squash) or reply on-thread explaining why not, then write the new cover
# letter to `.git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md` before finishing -- under
# .git/, not the working tree, so the "commit early and often" advice
# below cannot sweep it into a commit by accident (git tracks nothing
# under .git/; same convention fork-sandbox.sh itself uses for
# review-verdict.md and pi's session dir).
#
# After the run: this waits for summary.json (fork-sandbox.sh's own signal
# that the run -- and its fetch back into the real repo -- is fully over),
# then:
#
#   - Harvests any `.git/lkml-out/*.msg` reply files into the CURRENT threads,
#     exactly as lkml-round.sh does, whether or not any commits landed --
#     a reply explaining a disagreement is still worth posting even on a
#     round that changes no code.
#   - If, and only if, the run committed at least one commit AND left a
#     `.git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md`, runs `git format-patch` in the REAL repo
#     (never the clone) over the fetched branch, and posts the result as
#     the new version with `lkml-mailbox.sh init`.
#
# Exits non-zero, after still harvesting replies, when the run made no
# commits: that is this project's "a version changes nothing" stop
# condition (see skills/lkml-mode/SKILL.md), and it is the orchestrator's
# call whether to end the series there -- this script only reports it
# plainly rather than silently posting an unchanged version, and rather
# than deciding on its own that the series is done.

## What to do

For every open item above (and anything else tagged Question,
Changes-requested or NAK anywhere in the tree, even if it also shows up as
open), either fix the code and commit, or reply explaining why not -- see
"How to reply" below. An item you say nothing about is indistinguishable
from one you ignored.

Commit as you address each item, one logical change per commit -- not one
squash at the end. Uncommitted work is lost when this run ends, so commit
early and often rather than saving it all for a final commit.

When you are done, write the new cover letter, including a section headed
exactly \`## Changelog\` that says what changed because of which reviewer's
comment, to:

    .git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md

Under \`.git/\`, not the working tree: git tracks nothing there, so it
cannot end up staged or committed by the "commit early and often" habit
above.

The cover letter's FIRST LINE becomes the mailbox Subject verbatim, so
write it as a plain, short sentence -- no markdown heading marker, and no
"v2:" prefix (the mailbox already adds the version and patch numbering).

That file's presence is how the next step knows a new version is ready to
post. If you end this run having made no commits at all, still say so
plainly in your final report and do not fabricate a cover letter for a
version that changes nothing.

## How to reply

For anything you are answering with words rather than a code change,
write it as its own file under \`.git/lkml-out/\`, named \`1.msg\`, \`2.msg\`, ...
(not \`cover-letter.md\`, which is reserved for the new cover letter):

    In-Reply-To: <id>
    Subject: <optional -- default is "Re: <the parent's subject>">
    X-Tags: <optional, comma-separated: Reviewed-by, Acked-by, NAK, Changes-requested, Question>

    <your reply, quoting what you are answering with "> ">

\`In-Reply-To\` must name a message id that already exists in the thread
tree above (the full id or any unambiguous prefix). Ask a question rather
than guess when a comment itself is unclear.
