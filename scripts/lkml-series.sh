# lkml-series.sh — Re-roll an already-merged range into a reviewable series
#
# Usage: lkml-series.sh <series> --project <path> --range <base>..<tip>
#            [--author <persona>] [--parts <n>] [--hint <file>]
#            [--personas-dir <dir>] [--model-override <harness/model>]
#            [--timeout <seconds>]
#
# For post-hoc review of shipped work: <base>..<tip> already landed on
# main (or wherever), often as one merge commit or a pile of WIP commits
# that are not fit to post as a patch series. This launches the author
# persona once to recreate the SAME end state as thematic, individually
# reviewable commits, then format-patches that reconstruction as v1.
#
# --range     split on the FIRST ".." into <base> and <tip>. <base> is what
#             the reconstruction is diffed against and formatted from;
#             <tip> is the end state it must reproduce exactly.
# --parts     how many commits to split the range into. Optional -- the
#             author persona picks a sensible split (6-10) when omitted.
# --hint      a file with the operator's own suggested split (prose, a list
#             of themes, whatever) -- embedded in the handoff verbatim as a
#             suggestion, not a requirement the author must follow exactly.
# --author    which persona file speaks for the series. Defaults to
#             "author" -- see skills/lkml-mode/personas/author.md.
# --model-override <harness>[/<model>] overrides the author persona's own
#             harness/model for this run only. A BARE harness (no /model)
#             drops the persona's frontmatter model -- a model name belongs
#             to its harness (a bare pi-local resolves from the endpoint,
#             a bare claude takes the harness default); a combined
#             harness/model passes through verbatim. The frontmatter pins
#             are defaults, not policy: this machine's seats file
#             (LKML_SEATS_FILE, else ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-seats.yaml)
#             may re-seat the persona, key by key -- precedence
#             --model-override > seats personas.<p> > seats default: >
#             frontmatter (a seats harness without a model drops the
#             frontmatter's model). A missing file means the pins stand;
#             an unreadable or unparseable one refuses the run before the
#             launch. A seat the seats file changes is announced on stderr,
#             e.g. `lkml-series: seat author: pi, sealed (lkml-seats.yaml,
#             was claude/opus)`; --model-override wins over the seats file
#             silently.
# --timeout   seconds to wait for the run to finish. Default 3600.
#
# Launches ONE fork-sandbox.sh run, --checkout at <tip>, on a new branch
# named lkml/<series>-v1-<timestamp>. The persona's clone has full history
# (fork-sandbox.sh clones with --shared, never shallow), so <base> is
# reachable there even though the run starts checked out at <tip>. The
# handoff tells it to reset the branch to start at <base> and recreate the
# full <base>..<tip> diff as --parts (or its own judgement) thematic
# commits, each a real commit message -- then verify itself with
# `git diff <tip> HEAD`, which must print nothing.
#
# After the run: waits for summary.json, then verifies IN THE REAL REPO
# (never trusting the persona's own self-report) that the fetched branch's
# tree is byte-identical to <tip>'s -- `git diff --quiet <tip> <branch>`.
# A mismatch refuses outright and names the branch for manual inspection;
# nothing is format-patched. A match is `git format-patch <base>..<branch>`
# into <series>/patches-v1/, ready for `lkml-cover.sh` to post as v1 (this
# script does not call `lkml-mailbox.sh init` itself -- writing the cover
# letter is lkml-cover.sh's job).
#
# On success, appends {"version": 1, "branch": "<branch>"} to
# <series>/versions.jsonl -- the version-to-branch ledger lkml-forklift.sh
# reads to find a version's branch without guessing its timestamp.
# lkml-revise.sh appends the same shape for vN+1 after its own successful
# post.

This range already shipped -- it is being reviewed AFTER THE FACT, not
before merge. Your job is not to change what it does; it is to recreate
the SAME end state as a sequence of thematic, individually reviewable
commits, so a panel can review it the way it would have before merge.

Your clone is checked out on a new branch that currently starts at the
range's TIP ($tip_ref), with full history, so the range's BASE
($base_ref) is reachable in this same clone.

1. Reset this branch to start at the base:

       git reset --hard $base_ref

   (or any equivalent that leaves this branch's tip at $base_ref with a
   clean working tree).

2. Recreate the full diff between $base_ref and $tip_ref
   (\`git diff $base_ref $tip_ref\` in this same clone -- both are
   reachable here) as $parts_text, each with a real, honest commit
   message describing that piece alone.

3. Before you finish, verify yourself:

       git diff $tip_ref HEAD

   This MUST print nothing -- your reconstruction must be byte-identical
   to the original tip's tree, just split into a better commit history.
   If it prints anything, fix your commits until it does not. The host
   side of this script re-checks this same thing in the real repo and
   refuses to post anything if it disagrees with you.

Do not use this as a chance to fix bugs, refactor further, or otherwise
change behavior -- that is what the review round after this is for. This
step is purely about presenting the same change as a better history.
