# lkml-mailbox.sh — A Maildir-like message store for one lkml-mode series
#
# Usage: lkml-mailbox.sh init <series> --cover <file> --patches <dir> --from <persona> [--display <name>] [--version <n>] [--harness <h>] [--model <m>] [--network <pinned|sealed>] [--attach <file>]... [--diffstat <range>] [--smoke <file>]
#        lkml-mailbox.sh post <series> --from <persona> --reply-to <id> --file <file|-> [--display <name>] [--subject <s>] [--tags <t1,t2>] [--harness <h>] [--model <m>] [--network <pinned|sealed>] [--attach <file>]...
#        lkml-mailbox.sh tree <series> [--version <n>]
#        lkml-mailbox.sh cover <series> [--version <n>]
#        lkml-mailbox.sh show <series> <id>
#        lkml-mailbox.sh open <series> [--version <n>]
#        lkml-mailbox.sh tally <series> --version <n>
#
# --diffstat <range> and --smoke <file>, on `init` only, each append a
# section to the cover letter body AFTER whatever --cover already contains:
# `--diffstat` appends "## Diffstat" with the output of `git diff --stat
# <range>`, run with NO `-C` flag -- it uses THIS PROCESS'S current working
# directory, since this script takes no --project flag. A caller that wants
# the diffstat computed against a project other than its own cwd must `cd`
# into that project before invoking `init`, e.g. `(cd "$project" && "$mailbox"
# init ... --diffstat "$base..$branch")` -- which also means every OTHER path
# argument to that same `init` call (--cover, --patches, --smoke, --attach)
# must already be absolute. `--smoke <file>` appends "## Test results" with
# that file's contents verbatim. Refuses cleanly if the range fails to diff
# (e.g. cwd is not a git repo, or the range is nonsense) or the smoke file
# does not exist.
#
# Attachments. --attach <file> may repeat on `init` (attaches to the cover
# letter) or `post` (attaches to that one reply). Each file is copied into
# <series>/attachments/<basename> and the message gets one
# "X-Attachment: attachments/<basename>" header per file, alongside the
# other X-* headers -- so `show`, which just cats the whole message file,
# prints them as part of the header block it always printed, no special
# rendering needed. `tree` marks any message carrying at least one
# attachment with a trailing "📎" so a reader can tell at a glance that
# there is something outside the text to go look at (e.g. a screenshot a
# reviewer persona should look at, per the lkml-mode skill). Refused outright
# over 4 MiB -- this is a message store, not a file server. A basename that
# already exists under attachments/ with DIFFERENT content is refused too --
# the namespace is flat and keyed only on basename, so silently overwriting
# it would leave an earlier message's X-Attachment header pointing at the
# wrong file.
#
# One series lives under $LKML_MAILBOX_ROOT/<series>/cur/ (default
# /var/tmp/claude-scratch/lkml/<series>/cur), one file per message, named
# <uuid>.msg, written atomically (temp file + rename) so a concurrent reader
# never sees a half-written message and two concurrent posters never clobber
# each other -- each mints its own uuid.
#
# A message is RFC-822-shaped:
#
#   Message-ID: <uuid@lkml.local>
#   In-Reply-To: <parent-uuid@lkml.local>     (absent on a top-level post)
#   References: <id1@lkml.local> <id2@lkml.local> ...
#   Date: RFC-2822
#   From: <Display Name> (AI persona) <persona.ai@lkml.local>
#   Subject: ...
#   X-AI-Persona: <persona>
#   X-AI-Harness: <harness>
#   X-AI-Model: <model>
#   X-AI-Network: <pinned|sealed>   -- the seat's network mode at launch,
#            e.g. distinguishing a zero-cost local seat (pi, sealed) from
#            a networked one (pi, pinned) permanently: harness alone
#            cannot, since both resolve to the same "pi".
#   X-Series: <series>
#   X-Version: <n>
#   X-Depth: <n>
#   X-Tags: <comma-separated subset of Reviewed-by, Acked-by, NAK,
#            Tested-by, Changes-requested, Question -- empty when none apply>
#   X-Seq: <nanosecond epoch, for ordering only>
#
# X-Seq is not part of the human-facing schema above and its format is not a
# contract -- it exists solely because Date is RFC-2822 (one-second
# resolution), and a fast automated round can easily post several messages
# inside the same second, which would otherwise make "latest tag" and
# thread ordering depend on filesystem glob order rather than the order
# they actually happened in.
#
#   <body>
#
# lkml_post_raw() is the ONLY place a message file is ever written, and it
# unconditionally bakes "(AI persona)" into the From header. That is the
# whole enforcement of this project's non-negotiable AI-attribution rule --
# it lives here, in the one function that writes the data, not in any
# persona's good behavior.
#
# id7: every command that prints or renders a message id truncates it to 7
# characters for display, exactly like a short git sha. `post --reply-to`,
# `show <id>` and any id argument accept the full id or any unambiguous
# prefix of it.
#
# Depth. A top-level post (the cover letter `init` writes) is depth 0. Each
# of `init`'s patches is a direct child of the cover, depth 1. `post
# --reply-to` always inherits the version of the message it replies to, and
# sets its own depth to the parent's depth + 1 -- refusing outright, with a
# clear message, when that would exceed depth 30. There is no cap on the
# NUMBER of replies in a thread, only on how deep one chain of them may go.
#
# Version. `init` posts a new top-level thread. Its version defaults to one
# past the highest version already in the series (so `init` with no
# --version IS how v2, v3, ... get posted), or an explicit --version that
# must not already exist. `post` never creates a version; it always inherits
# the version of the thread it replies to.
#
# Design decision -- "open": a thread is open when its tip carries Question,
# Changes-requested or NAK, and no direct reply to it comes from a DIFFERENT
# persona than the one who tagged it. This mailbox has no way to know who a
# tagged message was addressed to -- that lives in prose -- so it uses the
# closest computable proxy: silence from anyone else. Deciding who should
# actually answer an open thread is the orchestrator's job, not this
# script's; `open` only points at candidates. With no --version, `open`
# scans the whole series, including earlier versions -- pass --version to
# scope it to one version, which is what "open is empty" as a convergence
# check (see SKILL.md) needs: an unanswered item from a superseded version
# should not keep the current version from converging.
#
# Design decision -- "tally": counts the LATEST tag per persona per patch
# (by Date), not every tag ever applied, since a Changes-requested is
# routinely superseded by a later Reviewed-by from the same reviewer once
# the request is met, and counting both would make convergence look stuck
# forever.
#
# This is deliberately not a daemon and takes no lock beyond the atomic
# rename: two posts landing in the same second get two different uuids and
# two different files, so there is nothing to serialize.
