# lkml-summarize.sh — Turn a finished lkml-mode review thread into
# condensed, actionable intelligence, written into the series dir.
#
# Usage: lkml-summarize.sh <series> --project <path> [--version <n>]
#            [--high <harness[/model]>] [--low <harness[/model]>]
#            [--timeout <seconds>] [--series]
#
# <series>   the mailbox series; its dir is $LKML_MAILBOX_ROOT/<series>.
# --project  the repo fork-sandbox.sh clones. Both tiers start at the
#            series' tip -- the branch recorded for the summarized
#            version in <series>/versions.jsonl -- on their own
#            throwaway branches, deleted again when the run returns
#            (the tiers make no commits, so the branches carry none).
# --version  which version to summarize (a plain integer N). Defaults
#            to the latest recorded version.
# --high     which harness[/model] the synthesis tier runs on.
# --low      which harness[/model] the extraction tier runs on.
#            A BARE harness (no /model) is passed to fork-sandbox.sh
#            bare, and nothing is expanded here -- pi-local resolves
#            its model from the endpoint itself. A combined
#            harness/model passes through verbatim. Do NOT hand a bare
#            harness a persona-style model name: the endpoint is asked
#            for it verbatim and the leg dies with zero replies -- what
#            the lkml-round.sh --model-override 404 lesson was about. Without the
#            flag, each tier falls back to the machine default in
#            ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-summarize.env (keys
#            LKML_SUMMARIZE_HIGH / LKML_SUMMARIZE_LOW, same form; the
#            file's path is overridable via LKML_SUMMARIZE_ENV_FILE),
#            then to the shipped defaults high=claude/opus,
#            low=claude/sonnet. Flags beat env, env beats default.
# --timeout  seconds to wait for each tier's run to finish. Default 3600.
# --series   synthesize the WHOLE series instead of one version: a
#            single synthesis run, no extraction tier. Its handoff
#            carries, inline, every recorded version's results-v<N>.
#            json intermediate (which must all exist already) verbatim
#            in version order, every version's tally section, and the
#            latest version's cover letter; it writes the whole-series
#            narrative to <series>/results-series.md -- what the series
#            does, the review arc v1 to vN, where it stands, what
#            happens next. Refuses --version ("pick one") and --low
#            (there is no extraction tier; --high still selects the
#            synthesis model), and refuses when any recorded version
#            lacks its results-v<N>.json.
# LKML_SUMMARIZE_HEARTBEAT_SECS controls the wait-loop progress heartbeat
# (default 60); it is read from the environment for tests and odd terminals.
# LKML_SUMMARIZE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES caps each tier handoff (default 409600);
# it is site config read from lkml-summarize.env, with the environment taking precedence.
#
# Input is `lkml-render.py --text <series-dir>` output ONLY -- never
# the HTML view. The render is carried inline in each tier's handoff
# because a sandboxed run cannot read the mailbox (the same lesson as
# lkml-round.sh's secretary seat, whose handoff carries the thread
# for exactly this reason).
#
# The pipeline is sequential, one sandboxed run per tier:
#   1. LOW tier (extraction): reads the whole --text thread and writes
#      a structured intermediate to its run's OUTBOX. This script
#      harvests it VERBATIM as <series>/results-v<N>.json and feeds it,
#      plus the render's tally section for this version, inline to
#   2. HIGH tier (synthesis): which writes the results document to its
#      run's OUTBOX, harvested as <series>/results-v<N>.md.
# Re-summarizing a version overwrites both files once both tiers have
# delivered their outbox files (a failed high tier leaves the previous
# pair untouched); the written paths are the last stdout lines.
#
# results-v<N>.md is a FORMAT CONTRACT, not a free-form essay -- a
# render round is meant to show # Summary as a small collapsed card
# (nothing in the tree depends on that yet):
#     # Summary
#     (1-2 short paragraphs: ~120 words; this script WARNS on stderr
#      above ~200)
#     # Details
#     (free-form: defect list with severity/status and message-id
#      citations, per-patch disposition, recommended next actions)
# Message ids are cited as bare 7-hex tokens (e.g. 9d67f5e) -- no
# brackets, no anchors: a plain convention that keeps the id greppable
# against the --text render.

You are the EXTRACTION tier of a two-tier summary of the lkml-mode

You are handed the whole thread below, as the mailbox's own --text
render, inlined: this sandbox cannot read the mailbox. It covers every
posted version; THIS summary is about the section headed
"$series v$version" -- earlier versions are there as context for what
changed.

The shape is a contract: a synthesis tier and a later render step
consume this JSON verbatim, so it must parse with jq and every field
must mean exactly what its name says:

- verdicts: per reviewer, the LATEST tag on this target is the current
  verdict; the tags its earlier messages on the same target carried,
  in thread order, go under superseded. Omit reviewers who never
  tagged.
- defects: every defect a reviewer claimed: severity (your read of its
  weight: high/medium/low), the claim in one sentence, file and line
  ONLY when the thread states them (omit otherwise), and status
  "confirmed" (someone verified it in the clone or by running the
  code) or "asserted" (claimed only, not verified).
- responses: for each defect or question the author answered, the
  stance "accepted" (fixed or conceded) or "pushed-back" (contested,
  with or without the reviewer's concession). A claim nobody answered
  gets stance "unanswered" and id null.
- open_questions: questions still standing -- tagged Question or
  simply never answered.
- duplicates: the same defect or question raised in more than one
  place (two reviewers, or one reviewer across versions).

Every single item carries the 7-hex message id(s) it comes from -- the
ids the render prints for each message. Record ONLY what the thread
states: do not review the code and do not invent findings.

Make NO commits and no other changes to the clone: writing
results.json to the outbox is the whole job. In your final report,
say how many patches you covered and how many defects you recorded.

build_high_handoff() {

You are the SYNTHESIS tier of a two-tier summary of the lkml-mode
review series $series, version $version.

You are handed (1) the structured intermediate the extraction tier
pulled from the whole thread, verbatim, and (2) the thread's tally
section for v$version. The intermediate was built from the entire
--text render of the mailbox, and it should make a source-dive
unnecessary: you MAY read this clone to chase a lead, but start from
the intermediate, not from the code.

Write ONE file: \`results.md\` at the root of the artifact outbox
directory named in your prompt, EXACTLY this shape:

    # Summary
    <one or two short paragraphs>

    # Details
    <free-form subsections>

The # Summary section is a small collapsed card in the intended final
layout: at most about 120 words, hard-capped at 200. One or two short
paragraphs: the state of the series (how the tally stands), the
defects that still matter, and what happens next. Nothing else.

# Details is free-form subsections: a defect list with severity,
status and its message-id citation, a per-patch disposition, and
recommended next actions.

Cite message ids as BARE 7-hex tokens, for example 9d67f5e -- no
brackets, no anchors, no <id@lkml.local>: a plain convention, and it
keeps the id greppable against the thread.

Make NO commits and no other changes to the clone: writing
results.md to the outbox is the whole job. In your final report, say
how many words the Summary section is.

    cat <<BRIEF
You are the SYNTHESIS run of a whole-series summary of the lkml-mode
review series $series, versions ${recorded_versions[0]} to $version.

You are handed (1) each recorded version's extraction intermediate
(results-v<N>.json), verbatim, in version order, (2) each version's
tally section from the thread's --text render, and (3) the cover
letter of the LATEST version (v$version), verbatim. The
intermediates were built from the entire --text render of the
mailbox, and they are the message-level detail: you MAY read this
clone to chase a lead, but start from them, not from the code.

Write ONE file: \`results.md\` at the root of the artifact outbox
directory named in your prompt, EXACTLY this shape:

    # Summary
    <two to three short paragraphs>

    # Details
    <one short paragraph per version, in version order>
    Open items
    <the latest version's standing items>
    Recommended next actions
    <for the latest version>

The # Summary is the deliverable: two to three short paragraphs,
about 150 words, hard cap 200, written as a brief to a maintainer
deciding whether to read further. Plain declarative sentences, no
bullet lists. It carries the whole story: what the series does (one
sentence, from the cover letter), the review arc (how many versions
were posted, what the review panel found at each version, what the
author changed in response -- from the intermediates and the
tallies), where the series stands now (the latest version's tally
state), and what happens next. Do NOT explain the review mechanism
(AI personas, sandboxes, how the review was run) -- the rendered
page's footer already carries that disclosure.

# Details is one short paragraph per version, in version order (v1:
posted N patches, the panel raised X, of which Y were confirmed; v2:
...), then "Open items" and "Recommended next actions" subsections
for the latest version.

Cite message ids as BARE 7-hex tokens, for example 9d67f5e -- no
brackets, no anchors, no <id@lkml.local>: a plain convention, and it
keeps the id greppable against the thread.

Make NO commits and no other changes to the clone: writing
results.md to the outbox is the whole job. In your final report, say
how many words the Summary section is.
