# lkml-cover.sh — Launch the author persona to write a cover letter for
# patches that already exist (e.g. lkml-series.sh's reconstruction), then
# post the version via lkml-mailbox.sh init.
#
# Usage: lkml-cover.sh <series> --project <path> --checkout <branch> --base <base>
#            --patches <dir> [--attach <file>]... [--smoke <file>] [--narrative <file>]
#            [--author <persona>] [--version <n>] [--personas-dir <dir>]
#            [--model-override <harness/model>] [--timeout <seconds>]
#
# <project>    the repo fork-sandbox.sh clones.
# --checkout   the branch the patches already live on -- e.g. the branch
#              lkml-series.sh's reconstruction landed on, or vN's branch
#              you are re-covering. This run makes NO commits, so nothing
#              is fetched back; --checkout only gives the author persona
#              something to read (git log/diff) while writing the cover
#              letter, and doubles as the version's branch recorded in
#              versions.jsonl (see below).
# --base       the base the patches were formatted against -- used both to
#              tell the author `git diff <base>...HEAD` and, on the host
#              side, to compute the `## Diffstat` section (see below).
# --patches    a `git format-patch` output directory, e.g. lkml-series.sh's
#              own patches-v1/. Its *.patch files are embedded as text
#              directly into the handoff -- NOT bound in with --context-ro
#              (which requires a directory under
#              /var/tmp/claude-scratch/forks/, which $LKML_MAILBOX_ROOT is
#              not by default) and not copied into .git/lkml-in/ (the
#              clone does not exist yet when this script builds the
#              handoff) -- same reasoning as lkml-round.sh embedding
#              `cover`/`tree` text straight into its own handoff.
# --attach     may repeat. Each file is passed through to `lkml-mailbox.sh
#              init --attach` AND described in a `## Attachments` section
#              this script appends to the cover letter itself (see below).
# --smoke      a file whose content becomes the cover's `## Test results`
#              section, appended by `lkml-mailbox.sh init --smoke`.
# --narrative  a file with the operator's own words for what this work is
#              for. Embedded verbatim into the handoff; the author is told
#              to open its cover with this, lightly edited, and never
#              contradict it.
# --author     which persona file speaks for the series. Defaults to
#              "author".
# --version    version to post as. Defaults to one past the series'
#              current highest version (the same default `lkml-mailbox.sh
#              init` applies on its own).
# --personas-dir defaults to skills/lkml-mode/personas beside this repo's
#              own scripts/ directory.
# --model-override <harness>[/<model>] overrides the author persona's own
#              harness/model for this run only. A BARE harness (no /model)
#              drops the persona's frontmatter model -- a model name belongs
#              to its harness (a bare pi-local resolves from the endpoint,
#              a bare claude takes the harness default); a combined
#              harness/model passes through verbatim. The frontmatter pins
#              are defaults, not policy: this machine's seats file
#              (LKML_SEATS_FILE, else ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-seats.yaml)
#              may re-seat the persona, key by key -- precedence
#              --model-override > seats personas.<p> > seats default: >
#              frontmatter (a seats harness without a model drops the
#              frontmatter's model). A missing file means the pins stand;
#              an unreadable or unparseable one refuses the run before the
#              launch. A seat the seats file changes is announced on stderr,
#              e.g. `lkml-cover: seat author: pi, sealed (lkml-seats.yaml,
#              was claude/opus)`; --model-override wins over the seats file
#              silently.
# --timeout    seconds to wait for the run to finish. Default 3600.
#
# This run is NOT allowed to make commits -- same convention as
# lkml-round.sh's reviewer runs. The handoff hands it the patches (embedded
# as text) and the operator's narrative (if any), and asks for exactly
# three sections, written to .git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md: a narrative,
# an implementation overview (one paragraph per patch, in series order),
# and what to look at first (3 places the author is least sure of) --
# prefaced by an AI-attribution paragraph the author writes itself, in its
# own words (see SKILL.md's "Attribution is non-negotiable"). Under
# .git/, not the working tree, for the same "commit early and often
# cannot sweep it up" reason every other lkml-mode handoff uses this
# convention for.
#
# After the run: waits for summary.json, refuses clearly if no
# cover-letter.md was written, then:
#
#   1. Appends a `## Attachments` section (one `Attachment: attachments/
#      <basename> — <n> bytes` line per --attach file) onto a COPY of the
#      author's cover-letter.md -- never the clone's own file.
#   2. Calls `(cd "$project" && lkml-mailbox.sh init ... --diffstat
#      "$base..$checkout" ${smoke:+--smoke "$smoke"} --attach ...)`, which
#      appends `## Diffstat` and, if --smoke was given, `## Test results`
#      after that.
#
# Final section order is therefore: the author's 3 sections, then
# Attachments, then Diffstat, then Test results -- not the attachments/
# diffstat/test-results top-to-bottom order a reader might expect, a
# consequence of lkml-mailbox.sh init posting immediately rather than
# returning a body for further editing.
#
# On success, appends {"version": <n>, "branch": "<checkout>"} to
# <series>/versions.jsonl, the same ledger lkml-series.sh/lkml-revise.sh
# write -- the branch given via --checkout IS the version's branch here,
# since this run makes no commits and the branch already exists in the
# real repo from lkml-series.sh or lkml-revise.sh.

## What to write

Write exactly three sections, after an AI-attribution paragraph you write
yourself, in your own words, stating plainly that every participant in
this series' review is an AI persona run in a sandbox:

1. **Narrative** -- what this is and why it exists (informed by the
   operator's own words above, when given).
2. **Implementation overview** -- one paragraph per patch, in series
   order.
3. **What to look at first** -- the 3 places you are least sure of.

Write it to:

    .git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md

Under `.git/`, not the working tree: git tracks nothing there, so it
cannot end up staged or committed by accident.

The FIRST LINE becomes the mailbox Subject verbatim, so write it as a
plain, short sentence -- no markdown heading marker.

Make no commits and no other repository changes. Writing
`.git/lkml-out/cover-letter.md` is the whole job this run.
