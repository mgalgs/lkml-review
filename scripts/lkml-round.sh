# lkml-round.sh — Launch one fork-sandbox run per persona, in parallel, to
# review (or reply within) an lkml-mode series, then harvest their replies
# back into the mailbox.
#
# Usage: lkml-round.sh <series> --project <path> --checkout <ref> --base <ref>
#            --personas <p1,p2,...> [--reply-to <id>]... [--personas-dir <dir>]
#            [--version <n>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--model-override <harness/model>]
#            [--services-trust-ref <ref>] [--k8s] [--endpoint <name>] [--no-summarize]
#
# <project>  the repo fork-sandbox.sh clones -- same argument it takes.
# --checkout the ref each persona's clone starts at: the series' tip, with
#            the patches under review already applied.
# --base     the commit the patches are applied on top of. Told to a
#            reviewer with no --reply-to, so it can `git diff <base>...HEAD`
#            in its own clone instead of guessing the range.
# --personas comma-separated persona slugs, each naming a file
#            <personas-dir>/<persona>.md. Every persona in the list gets
#            launched, whatever the task -- see the lkml-mode skill for why
#            "core" belongs on every panel. A persona file's frontmatter
#            may carry `thinking: <level>` (pi's --thinking values); it is
#            passed to that seat's pi via --pi-args on the pi and pi-local
#            harnesses and ignored on the others.
# --reply-to may repeat. With none given, every launched persona reviews the
#            WHOLE series fresh. With one or more given, every launched
#            persona is told to reply ONLY to those specific threads --
#            this is how a round answers open questions rather than
#            re-reviewing everything.
# --personas-dir defaults to skills/lkml-mode/personas beside this repo's
#            own scripts/ directory.
# --version  which version of the series this round is about. Defaults to
#            the version of the first --reply-to id, or the series' current
#            (highest) version when reviewing fresh.
# --timeout  seconds to wait for every launched run to finish before giving
#            up on harvesting the stragglers. Default 3600. Also the value
#            passed to the post-round summarizer: a round the operator
#            tightened for is a tail the operator tightened for.
# --no-summarize skip the automatic post-round summary. By default, once
#            the harvest is done and harvested at least one reply, the round
#            runs lkml-summarize.sh (resolved from PATH) with the series,
#            --project, the round's own resolved --version and --timeout,
#            so the operator sees where the thread stands after every round
#            instead of at the end. A summary skipped because nothing was
#            harvested costs nothing; a FAILED summary never fails the round
#            -- the replies are already posted to the mailbox, and the
#            summary can be re-run by hand. Refused at startup if
#            lkml-summarize.sh is not on PATH.
# --k8s        run the whole panel as Kubernetes Jobs through
#            fork-sandbox-k8s.sh instead of local fork-sandbox.sh runs;
#            requires --endpoint. The seats are submitted back to back
#            (submit is non-blocking), then every uncollected seat is
#            PROBED with a short `wait` in a round-robin loop and
#            collected the moment it completes: a pod idles after its
#            agent exits and then exits at its TTL, and once the
#            container is gone neither the branch nor the outbox can be
#            pulled back, so waiting each seat out in turn would lose
#            every seat that finished before its turn came. --timeout is
#            the overall deadline; on hitting it the round warns and
#            harvests what has been collected, the same as the local
#            path. Each seat's replies are pulled back to its own outbox
#            directory, named after its branch under
#            /var/tmp/claude-scratch/forks/lkml-round-k8s/ and harvested
#            from there, so one seat can never stamp another's replies.
#            A sealed seat -- network: sealed in the frontmatter, or the
#            pi-local alias that expands to it -- is translated to pi
#            against --endpoint (a pod has no sealed local endpoint; the
#            endpoint reaches the same self-hosted model through the
#            in-cluster proxy), not refused. Any other seat -- a
#            harness that is not pi or claude (e.g. codex), or a
#            model-less claude seat, which submit would refuse once
#            the seats ahead of it had already been submitted -- is
#            refused in the seats pre-pass, before any seat is
#            submitted. A cluster run has
#            no summary.json, so a seat's replies are stamped with its
#            configured model; a model-less seat is stamped with the
#            model the pod itself discovered (brought home in the
#            outbox), or "unknown" when even that is absent (post
#            refuses an empty model), and its runs.jsonl ledger
#            line records the branch, marked cluster, with no cost --
#            a cluster run's cost is unknown, not free.
# --endpoint <name> the registered K8S_PROXY_ENDPOINTS entry the pi
#            seats (including sealed seats translated to pi for the
#            cluster) are wired to via fork-sandbox-k8s.sh submit
#            --endpoint. Required with --k8s: endpoint names are
#            site-specific configuration, so this repo ships none and
#            refuses to guess.
# --model-override <harness>[/<model>] overrides every persona's own
#            harness/model for this round only -- useful for a cheap
#            smoke-test round before spending on the real panel. A BARE
#            harness (no /model) drops each persona's frontmatter model --
#            a model name belongs to its harness, the same rule as a
#            seats-file harness without a model: composing it onto the bare
#            harness would ask the endpoint for e.g. 'opus' on pi-local
#            and the leg dies with zero replies (the --model-override 404
#            lesson); a bare pi-local resolves its model from the endpoint,
#            a bare claude takes the harness default. A combined
#            harness/model passes through verbatim. The
#            persona frontmatter pins are defaults, not policy: this
#            machine's seats file (LKML_SEATS_FILE, else
#            ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-seats.yaml) may re-seat any
#            persona, per persona, key by key -- precedence
#            --model-override > seats personas.<p> > seats default: >
#            frontmatter (lkml-seats-resolve owns the rules; a seats
#            harness without a model drops the frontmatter's model). A
#            missing file means the pins stand; an unreadable or
#            unparseable one refuses the whole round before any launch.
#            Every seat the seats file changes is announced on stderr,
#            e.g. `lkml-round: seat core: pi, sealed (lkml-seats.yaml,
#            was claude/opus)`; --model-override wins over the seats file
#            silently -- it flattens the whole roster, so per-persona
#            seat announcements would be noise.
# --services-trust-ref <ref> is passed through to every seat's
#            fork-sandbox.sh launch. Without it, fork-sandbox.sh disables
#            the repo's .agents/sandbox-services hook on a --checkout run
#            (its warning lands in the captured launch output, unseen), so
#            seats get no per-run services and no provision-ro binds. Pass
#            the trusted base the series came from (e.g. the --base ref);
#            each seat's hook then runs iff its checkout did not change the
#            sandbox-services contract relative to that ref.
#
# What this launches, per persona: a fork-sandbox.sh run (or, with
# --k8s, a fork-sandbox-k8s.sh submit of the same seat as a cluster Job
# -- same handoff, same branch, no local tmux), --checkout at the
# series' tip, with a handoff built from the persona file, the mailbox's
# `cover` and `tree` output, and (with --reply-to) the specific threads to
# answer. The secretary seat additionally gets the whole thread's message
# bodies, as a `lkml-render.py --text` render: it summarizes the
# discussion rather than reviewing the diff, and its sandbox cannot read
# the mailbox, so the handoff itself must carry the thread. The run
# makes NO commits -- it writes its replies as <n>.msg files in the
# run's artifact outbox (the absolute path its own prompt preamble
# gives it), which sits outside the clone: the project's "commit early
# and often" instinct cannot sweep a reply into a commit by accident --
# and the --k8s mode serves a cluster run the same way: the outbox is
# the only channel that carries a file out of a pod, and collect pulls
# it back to the seat's own directory. Launches are started back to
# back rather than backgrounded with `&`: each fork-sandbox.sh call returns
# as soon as its own detached tmux session exists, so by the time the last
# one is launched every session is already running concurrently -- the same
# "launch them back to back" idiom the fork-sandbox skill's own Parallelism
# section documents for fanning out several runs.
#
# After every launched run has written summary.json -- fork-sandbox.sh's
# own signal that the run is fully over, including its (possibly empty)
# fetch back into the real repo, written strictly after exit-code (the
# --k8s mode's analogue is the wait/collect loop: each seat is probed
# with a short `wait` and collected the moment it completes) -- each
# run's artifact outbox is read directly -- `cat`, never git -- for
# *.msg files, with a fall back to the old .git/lkml-out/ directory in
# the run's clone for a seat that ignored the outbox instruction in its
# prompt and wrote to the old location instead: the outbox wins when it
# holds any reply, so a seat that somehow wrote to both is posted once,
# never twice. The replies are posted into the mailbox via
# lkml-mailbox.sh post,
# stamped with that persona's own harness/model and display name. A
# reply file with no In-Reply-To header is skipped with a clear
# warning; the rest of that run's replies still land.

## How to reply

Write each thing you have to say as its own file under the artifact
outbox directory whose absolute path is given in the "Artifact outbox"
section above, named `1.msg`, `2.msg`, `3.msg` ... The outbox is outside
this clone entirely, so nothing written there can end up staged or
committed by accident. Never write anything named `handoff.md` there --
that name is reserved for the run's own self-refresh protocol, and the
`.msg` naming already keeps you clear of it. Each file looks like:

    In-Reply-To: <id>
    Subject: <optional -- default is "Re: <the parent's subject>">
    X-Tags: <optional, comma-separated: Reviewed-by, Acked-by, NAK, Changes-requested, Question>

    <your message body>

Rules, all load-bearing:

- **One message per distinct thing you have to say.** Do not bundle several
  separate review comments into one file.
- **`In-Reply-To` must name a message id that already exists** in the
  thread tree above (the full id or any unambiguous prefix of it). That id
  comes from the mailbox and from nowhere else. **A git commit sha is not a
  message id**, however much the short form looks like one -- if you have
  been reading git history, do not reach for what you found there. (The
  mailbox will map a sha to the [PATCH] message that carries it when it
  can, but that is a safety net, not the address.) You cannot reply to a file from
  earlier in this same batch either -- ids are only assigned once your
  reply is posted to the mailbox, which happens after this run ends, so
  nothing you write in this round has an id of its own yet.
- **Tag only when you mean it.** `Reviewed-by` means you would put your
  name on the patch as committed. `Acked-by` means the approach is right
  but you have not verified every line. `NAK` means this must not be
  merged as it stands. `Changes-requested` and `Question` are for exactly
  what they say.
- **Quote what you are responding to**, with `> ` at the start of each
  quoted line, the way an email reply does.
- **Ask a question rather than guess** when you are not sure.
- **Make no commits and no other repository changes.** Do not edit, stage
  or commit anything. The outbox is outside the clone entirely, so there
  is no reason to touch the repository at all: writing the `.msg` files
  to the artifact outbox is the whole job this round.
- In your final report, say how many `.msg` files you wrote in the
  artifact outbox and, in one line each, what each one says.
