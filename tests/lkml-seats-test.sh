# lkml-seats-test.sh — Exercise the lkml-mode machine seats file: the
# lkml-seats-resolve helper's precedence and refusal rules directly, and
# lkml-round.sh consuming them end to end against a stub fork-sandbox.sh,
# the same "stub the external command on PATH" pattern
# tests/lkml-round-test.sh uses.
#
# Usage: tests/lkml-seats-test.sh
#
# The helper tests call scripts/lkml-seats-resolve with LKML_SEATS_FILE
# pointed at fixtures (its documented test hook) and a controlled HOME,
# so neither a real ~/.config/fork-sandbox/lkml-seats.yaml nor the
# machine's own HOME can leak in. The integration tests launch the real
# lkml-round.sh against the stub and inspect the argv each persona was
# actually launched with, plus the stderr announcements.
