# lkml-round-test.sh — Exercise lkml-round.sh's launch and harvest logic
# against a stub fork-sandbox.sh, the same "stub the external command on
# PATH" pattern tests/fork-sandbox-k8s-test.sh uses for pi; the --k8s
# mode is exercised the same way against a stub fork-sandbox-k8s.sh that
# records its verb calls in order.
#
# Usage: tests/lkml-round-test.sh
#
# No sandbox, no bwrap, no real agent: the stub fork-sandbox.sh captures its
# own --task-meta, fabricates a run directory whose outbox (and, for some
# seats, whose clone's .git/lkml-out) already holds *.msg replies, writes
# summary.json immediately (so lkml-round.sh's wait loop never actually
# sleeps), and prints the same "  run dir:  <path>" line the real launcher
# does. What is under test is entirely lkml-round.sh's own logic: parsing
# that line, waiting for summary.json, harvesting *.msg replies from the
# outbox (falling back to .git/lkml-out for a seat that wrote there
# instead), and posting them through lkml-mailbox.sh with the launching
# persona's own attribution.
